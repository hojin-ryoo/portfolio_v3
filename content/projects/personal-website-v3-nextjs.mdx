### Date: December 24th, 2024

## Project Summary

After working with Astro for my v2 portfolio, I decided it was time for another major upgrade. I've now migrated my entire portfolio to **Next.js**, taking advantage of its powerful React ecosystem, server-side rendering capabilities, and modern development experience.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages that make it perfect for a modern portfolio:

- **React-based**: Full access to the React ecosystem and component libraries
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and initial load performance
- **App Router**: Modern routing with layouts and nested routes
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration
- **Optimized Performance**: Built-in image optimization and code splitting
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, excellent tooling, and great documentation

## Key Features

- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design built with TailwindCSS
- **Dark Mode**: Seamless theme switching
- **Project Showcase**: Dynamic project pages rendered from MDX content
- **Contact Form**: Interactive contact form for reaching out
- **Performance**: Optimized images, fonts, and bundle sizes

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Content**: MDX for project posts
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## What's Next?

I'm excited to continue building on this foundation and adding more interactive features, animations, and content to showcase my work!
