# TypeScript Tips for Better Code

TypeScript brings type safety to JavaScript, helping catch errors early and improving code maintainability. Here are some essential tips.

## Use Strict Mode

Always enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json`:

\`\`\`json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Leverage Type Inference

TypeScript can infer types in many cases. Don't add unnecessary type annotations:

\`\`\`typescript
// Good
const name = "John";

// Unnecessary
const name: string = "John";
\`\`\`

## Use Union Types

Union types allow a value to be one of several types:

\`\`\`typescript
type Status = "loading" | "success" | "error";
\`\`\`

## Interface vs Type

Use `interface` for object shapes that might be extended, and `type` for unions, intersections, and computed types.

## Conclusion

TypeScript is a powerful tool that can significantly improve your development workflow. Start with these basics and gradually explore more advanced features.
