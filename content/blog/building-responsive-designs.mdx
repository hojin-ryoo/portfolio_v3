# Building Responsive Designs with Tailwind CSS

Responsive design is crucial in today's multi-device world. Tailwind CSS makes it easy to create responsive layouts using utility classes.

## Mobile-First Approach

Tailwind uses a mobile-first breakpoint system. This means you design for mobile devices first, then add styles for larger screens:

\`\`\`jsx
<div className="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
  Responsive text sizing
</div>
\`\`\`

## Breakpoints

Tailwind provides several breakpoints:

- `sm`: 640px and up
- `md`: 768px and up
- `lg`: 1024px and up
- `xl`: 1280px and up
- `2xl`: 1536px and up

## Grid Layouts

Creating responsive grids is simple:

\`\`\`jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  {/* Grid items */}
</div>
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Start Mobile**: Design for the smallest screen first
2. **Use Flexbox/Grid**: Leverage Tailwind's layout utilities
3. **Test Regularly**: Check your designs on multiple devices
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add features for larger screens

## Conclusion

With Tailwind CSS, responsive design becomes intuitive and maintainable. The utility-first approach allows you to build complex layouts quickly while keeping your code readable.
